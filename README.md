Pictures were taken from free repository [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com "pixabay").
Reviews system  based on David Adam's tutorial on [codeshack.io](https://codeshack.io/review-system-php-mysql-ajax/ "codeshack.io").

Original task was:
"Linus is an electrician. While he works on projects outside of his office he gets about 4 to 5 calls per day on his mobile phone by potentially new clients. This can be very distracting. He wishes that he had a website where his clients can see his availability and book him online."
